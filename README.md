## Synopsis

This project is under development. The intent is to create a simple database of cocktail recipes with a basic web-based UI.

## Motivation

I like cocktails and I like trying new recipes, but I have a hard time remembering what exactly
I've tried, whether I liked it, and what the exact recipe is. But searching for recipes by
ingredient can be very frustrating with hard copy books, so I wanted to create something that
would support:

* Adding simple recipes
* Rating recipes
* Searching by name
* Searching by ingredient or set of ingredients

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/tuck182/boothby

## License
